The most complicated static webpage ever.

Originally intended to be more dynamic with itemized items (parts of the bike, saddle, spokes etc)
that could be purchased using Google shopping cart. However, I realized after a few items there would
only be the expensive frame left and it became apparent I would have to answer a bunch of tax 
questions to become a seller I went with PayPal donations. Donations allow people to donate any amount
and they aren't left with the wierd feeling of only buying us spokes. 

Still a good exercise to figure out the beginings of Google App Engine.

FYI:
I would never buy domain through Google again. It randomly quite pointing to my app and their 
support is non-existent or sucks.
