An overly complicated static webpage.

Originally intended to be more dynamic with bike broken down into individual items that 
people could buy (ie. Parts of the bike, saddle, spokes, etc) I realized when trying to break the bike
down there weren't going to be many items and that I would still be left with expensive 
items such as the frame and rims. Also discovered that I was going to have to answer a bunch of
tax questions to be able to use be a Google Seller. So I went with PayPal donations. 
Donations allowed people to donate any amount and they aren't going to be left with the 
weird feeling of buying us spokes or pedals. 

Still a good exercise to figure out the beginnings of Google App Engine.

FYI:
I would never buy domain through Google again. It randomly quite pointing to my app and their 
support is non-existent or sucks.
